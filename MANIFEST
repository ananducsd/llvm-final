We have provided a directory named part2_benchmarks as part of the Turn-In.
This folder contains the various benchmarks that we used to run our analysis passes on.
The code for our Passes is present the llvm/src/lib/CSE231 directory and need no special build commands.
They can be directly compiled using the make command as in Part 1.

However, the benchmarks are C files that the the analyses run on and 
need to be compiled separately. The names of these benchmarks are self-explanatory.

We have provided a compileAndRunAnalysis.sh file in the same folder.
This scipt is used to run the analysis passes on the benchmarks with the following command:

./compileAndRunAnalysis.sh file-name pass-name 

For pass-name reference use:
 CSEPass           : common subexpression elimination
 RangePass         : Range analysis
 BranchFoldingPass : Branch folding
 ConstPass         : Constant propagation and folding
 alias_analysis	   : Pointer Analysis


For file_name reference: 

Constant Propagation Pass is run on the following files:

constProp.c 
constProp2.c

Range Analysis Pass is to be run on the following files:

range.c
range2.c
range3.c

Common Sub-Expression Analysis Pass is to be run on the following files:

cse.c

Alias Analysis Pass is to be run on the following files:

alias.c
alias2.c
